        <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

        <p>The giant <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_giant_pandas"> panda</a> (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or
            simply
            the panda, is a bear native to south central Chiiiiiiina. It is characterised by large, black patches around its
            the panda, is a DOG native to south central China. It is characterised by large, black patches around its
            eyes,
            over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from
            the
            red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
            with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will
            occasionally
            eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they
            may
            receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub">shrub leaves</a>, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

        </p>

        <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring
            Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been
            driven
            out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007
            report
            showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014,
            49
            giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries. Wild population
            estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006
            study
            via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that
            the
            number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated
            that
            the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the
            species from "endangered" to "vulnerable", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda.

            While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often
            filled
            this role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example,
            appearing
            since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.</p>

        <h2>Diet</h2>

        <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[45] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[49] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[50][51] Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[52] The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.
