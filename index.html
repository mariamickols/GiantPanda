        <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

        <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or
            simply
            the panda, is a bear native to south central China. 
        </p>
            
            <p>It is characterised by large, black patches around its
            eyes,
            over the ears, and across its round body.</p>

            <p>
                The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from
            the
            red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
            with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Giant pandas in the wild will
            occasionally
            eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
            
        </p>

        <p>
             In captivity, they
            may
            receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

        <h2>Diet</h2>

        <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous,
            consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[45] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a
            carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[49] and thus derives little energy and little protein from
            consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[50][51]
            Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest
            vegetation.[52] The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in
            bamboo forests for millions of years.
